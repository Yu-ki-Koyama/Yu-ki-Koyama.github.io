Automating tasks by using robots is something I've been passionate about.

I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. I am currently a member of the Harada Laboratory (formerly <a href='http://www.nml.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/'>Mitsuishi-Harada Laboratory</a>). 

I received the Bachelor's degree (2018) in Mechanical Engineering from the <a href='http://www2.mech.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/'>Department of Mechanical Engineering</a>, the University of Tokyo. I obtained the Master's degree (2020) in Mechanical Engineering from the <a href='https://www.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/soe'>Graduate School of Engineering</a>, the University of Tokyo.

Currently, I've been working on automating tasks of eye surgery using industrial robots. Notably, <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9695979'>TMRB22</a>, <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05567'>ICRA23 (Accepted for publication)</a>.

[](I have strong technical skills, particularly in robotics, system integration, and programming, and an academic background in engineering and surgical robotics.)

[](In my graduate studies, I've been working on automating tasks of eye surgery using industrial robots. Through this experience, I was impressed by the robot's potential to be versatile in dealing with various problems depending on how it is implemented. As the next step in my career, I would like to work with robots to solve everyday problems in society. Also, I would like to pursue a global career to expand my horizons and possibilities.)

[](Proficient: ROS, Python, C++, Linux
Knowledgeable: Kinematics, Quaternions, Constrained Optimization Algorithms)
